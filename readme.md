# Capstone Project : FusionBites

## Project Overview

The project aims to automate the identification of images that align with the concept of "FusionBites", a new, unique food concept that blends sushi and sandwiches. This would involve analyzing a dataset composed of images tagged as either sushi or sandwiches.

## Problem Statement

The challenge lies in creating an automated workflow or method capable of effectively and accurately identifying potential instances of "FusionBites" based on the given dataset. This task includes parsing through images labeled as sushi or sandwiches and determining whether they could potentially be classified as "FusionBites", a combination of the two.
